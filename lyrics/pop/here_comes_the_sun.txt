Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo
Here comes the sun
And I say, "It's all right"
Little darlin'
It's been a long, cold, lonely winter
Little darlin'
It feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, doo-doo-do
Here comes the sun
And I say, "It's all right"
Little darlin'
The smile's returning to the faces
Little darlin'
It seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say, "It's all right"
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Little darlin'
I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darlin'
It seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo
Here comes the sun
And I say, "It's all right"
Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right
