Time just floated by
Where I wanna know
Right between these eyes
Is how I wanna go
Oh something changed
I'll deal with it
Maybe I
Was always there
All I wanna be ... he he
Is something so good
Something so good
Something so real
I know that I should
I know that I would
I was floating by
Where I wanna be
Right between these lines
Is how I wanna see
Idiots
I'll deal with them
Maybe I
Was always there
All I wanna be ... he he
Is something so good
Something so good
Something so real
I knew that I should
I know that I would
I knew that I would
I know that I should
Cos
Time just floated
Time just floated
Time just floated
Time just floated
